						<br><br>
						 <p class="text-white">Sparkstone began in November 2014 as a simple project with the goal of building high performance algorithms for trading on the markets. With this in mind, Ryan approached his hallmates, Rishab and Sacheth to get them on board. They became the co-founders for the project and the Quant Project was initiated. Slowly as the project progressed, complexities unfolded and we looked to add more members and renamed the group the Sparkstone Project. Eventually we looked into obtaining a proprietary trading account which required a company so we formed Sparkstone Analytics LLC to get established. Today we are a strong team of seven based around the Cornell campus innovating our system and strategies every day.</p>
						 <br><br>
						 <p class="text-white">Sparkstone began as a project to build, test and trade algorithmic strategies which led to work on our proprietary analytics platform. This platform can accommodate numerous strategies as well as data sources due to its custom design. We are now looking to integrate various techniques into optimizing our analysis and construction. </p>
