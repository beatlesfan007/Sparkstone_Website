					<h1 class="text-white">History</h1>
						<br><br>
						<p class="text-white">In November 2014, a few bright young minds came together to experiment with trading algorithms. This curiosity evolved into a full-fledged project amongst hall mates. They would go back and forth across the rooms talking over ideas, meeting on Saturday mornings and collaborating late at night. When summer began, this intrepid group turned their focus to constructing a multi-strategy execution environment for trading on different algorithms.</p>
						<br /><br />
						<p class="text-white">At this point, the rapid development of the project made it beneficial to file as an LLC, creating what is now Sparkstone Analytics. We have the ability to trade on the markets and rapidly iterate strategies and are looking forward to making even more significant progress this year. </p>
