          <br>
          <p class="text-white">Our journey began in 2014 as a project amongst dorm mates to build high-performance trading algorithms. We looked for an analytics platform to support our efforts, but found nothing that met our requirements. Undeterred, we spent a year collaborating
            across dorm rooms, crafting our own proprietary platform to perfect our strategies and augment our data sources. Seeing what we had built, our aspirations grew, and we founded Sparkstone Analytics.</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p class="text-white">Today, we are a passionate team pioneering algorithmic trading strategies, crafted with innovative analytics. We optimize our system daily, and rapidly iterate our algorithms to trade on the markets. Driven by our belief that the market rate
            of return is never good enough, we look forward to the challenges and late night coffee runs that will help us to build on our successes.</p>
